# diceGame
Hello, I did this dice game. All codes belongs to me. I used some CSS and more JavaScript. This project is familiar with Angela Yu Course. But, I add a button in this project and I roll the dice push the button. In original project, when the page refresh the dices roll. It is really enjoyable for me.
